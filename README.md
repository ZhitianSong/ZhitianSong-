# Eyes on You

## Description

This project explores the interaction between the audience and the artwork. Users can control the direction of the pupil by moving the mouse. The size of the eyeballs changes with the mouse movement, creating a sense of being observed and enhancing engagement. Additionally, the project delves into concepts like volume expansion, volume compression, visual image formation through line changes, and their psychological impact.
